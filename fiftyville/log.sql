-- | Ruth    | Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get
-- |         | into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away. If you have

-- |         | look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.

-- | Eugene  | I dont know the thiefs name, but it was someone I recognized.
-- |         | Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emmas bakery, I was
-- |         | walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there
-- |         | withdrawing some money.
-- +---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
-- | Raymond | As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who
-- |         | talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the
-- |         | thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight
-- |         | out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on
-- |         | the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
-- +---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------

-- From Ruth:
--  Check bakery_security_logs for car that exited the parking lot between
--  10:15am and 10:25am on the day of the theft.

--  Check atm_transcations for withdrawls on Legget on the day of the theft.
-- From Raymond:
--  Check phone_calls for calls around 10:15am with <1m duration.
--  Caller is thief, recipient is accomplice, so mark both on suspects list.
